------------> state should be respected in frontend and backend

{
  players: {
    [id]: {
      x, y, lives, speed, bombs, flameLength, ...
    }
  },
  map: [...], // grid with walls, blocks, powerups
  bombs: [...], // {x, y, ownerId, timer}
}


🟢 Phase 1: Setup
 Create project folder structure
 Reuse/setup your custom mini DOM framework
 Create index.html, main.js, and server.js
 Set up static file server (Node.js + Express or similar)
 Set up WebSocket server (e.g. using ws)

🟡 Phase 2: Multiplayer Chat (WebSocket "Hello World")
 Prompt user for nickname on entry screen
 Connect to WebSocket server with nickname
 Display player count in lobby
 Implement chat input + message log
 Send/receive chat messages through WebSocket
 Broadcast messages to all clients

🔵 Phase 3: Lobby System
 Show number of players in lobby
 Start 10s countdown when 2–4 players connect
 Auto-start game after countdown
 Prevent players from joining after game starts

🔴 Phase 4: Core Game Engine
 Fixed-size grid map (e.g. 13x13)
 Add indestructible walls in fixed pattern
 Randomly place destructible blocks
 Reserve spawn zones in 4 corners
 Sync map between all clients via WebSocket

🟠 Phase 5: Player Mechanics
 Add 2–4 players at spawn corners
 Add keyboard movement (arrow/WASD)
 Prevent wall/block collision
 Display player DOM elements on map

🟣 Phase 6: Bomb Mechanics
 Allow dropping bombs with key press
 Bomb explodes after 3s
 Explosion affects blocks and players
 Add flame powerups (increase explosion range)
 Add bomb count powerups

🟤 Phase 7: Game Rules & Sync
 Add lives (3 per player)
 Respawn logic or death screen
 Broadcast full game state (positions, bombs, powerups)
 Keep server as single source of truth

⚫ Phase 8: Finishing Touches
 Add win condition (last player standing)
 Restart game option
 Optimize DOM updates and animations
 Maintain smooth 60fps with requestAnimationFrame

🟧 (Bonus) Optional Features
 Ghost after death mode
 Team mode (2v2)
 AI bot player(s)
 Extra powerups (Detonator, Bomb Pass, etc.)
 Powerup drops on death
